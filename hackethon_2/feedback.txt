Hello Daniel this is your Hackaton feedback. I liked the idea of your app, of course i am also a soccer fan. 
There is some things for the future to be aware. First to all when sharing a project where there is a database
be shure that you use a database that is in a server accesible for everyone like Heroku and not in your local
computer as i had to create the database in my computer to be able to run the app. Or make your project create a database
in any local computer the first time it is run. Then when i want to add a player you just put a message as 
put the information separated with comas, but there is nothing telling the user how many arguments is waiting, 
wich time of arguments are, so it was very easy to crush the app beacuse i amm not shure wich information sql is 
waiting for me to add, try to make it more clear for the user. Same as edit is really not easy to understand how to.
Well done working with a database conection and using all the differents aspects of it. In the future will be better
if you include an interface with forms to be more user friendly. 
You could also add a way of ordering the players for matches or goals or by alphabet.


Congratulations on your Hackaton keep working hard.
